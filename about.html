    <h3>Here's a bit about me....</h3>
    <div class="about-para">
      <p id="primary">I'm a 33 year old, soon to be 34 year old on Friday the 13th, that hopefully will be cheering on a victorious Clemson program after a win in the national championship.</p>
      <p id="secondary">I've been married for 3 years, almost 4 in May, and have two beautiful girls named Nina (2 years old) and Kaiya (6 years old - soon to be 7 on the 31st of January). Fun fact, both of my children are named because of the love of music my wife and I share. Kaiya is a play off of Bob Marley's "Kaya" album and song "Kaya". Kaya is a word describing enlightenment. My daughter Nina is named after the legendary Nina Simone.</p>
